* First step we took the position of batman
* Batman should able to jump certain limits based on dombdir
* Dombdir value (up, right, down-right)
* Based on Dombdir value we have to calculate the poistion
* then we are tracking batman actually which direction he should travel
* If (x,y) is (2,3) then we track the current position
* that is where the batman should move
* According to the position we are moving one step at a time
* the actuall rules is (one step should move at a time, total 6 steps within the 6 steps he should find bomb)
